He was seen days later by an doctors assistant and was told nothing was wrong. He filed an grievence to see an actual doctor. Six weeks later he was seen by the facility doctor and was told he might have a pinch nerve in his neck. Four months later the pinch never was confirmed and  a ooutside doctor said he needs surgery. A year later he still is waiting for the surgery and even steriod shots. Also, there are several suicide units at Great Meadow and men who express desire to hurt themselves are put into suicide smocks. For reasons unknown they shuffle inmates from the mental health unit to the TTSU unit in front of everyone. This is tantamount to releasing private OMH information about that inmate.

He sustained two injuries from the hospital , sergeon and or team of assistants. I was placed on two medications that gave me bad side effects. This transpired at first Coxsackie and then here at Eastern. The meds caused pain, nipple growth and nipple discharge. I was seen by the urologist twice and the endocrinologist once. Both recommended treatment . The urologist recomended the treatment twice and the endocrinologist recommended it once. The recommendations were denied by Albany Central Office Chief Medical Director Karl Koeniggsman. They kept telling me to go to sick call and I will be treated. That never happened. My family called to no avail. He was sent to Eastern from Coxsackie in August 2018. He finally saw a endocrinologist on a trip to Coxsackie. He recommended another similar medication to th eone originally recommended. They are Aromatase inhibotrs. The original was Arimidex (anastrozole). Next he recommended Tamoxifen (nolvadex) another aromatase inhibitor. He did this to avoid anymore denials in treatment recommendations and to not delay treatment any longer. I was 8 1/2 months without treatment. The Eastern CF medical Dr. Guzman ordered the meds right away. When asked why was this approved and the other recommendations were not I was told "It is because the Tamoxifen was on their approved list of meds. So the whole time NYS had an alternative medication to treat me but did not recommend it. That is negilgence and deliberate indifference.\n\nStatus Update: TY LETTER	\N	2019-04-22	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

The top 3 concerns are varbal and physical abuse by staff, Transfer to facility closer to family and inedible meals due to budget. However Mr. Deleon in his letter to CANY he discribes transfers to other facilities and the conditions: "During an inmate transfer officers and transport sergeant defraud the state of over-time by taking 19 hours to transport us from Malone to Ulster. A drive that should take 6 hours." The results are inmates are handcuffed and chained from 5:30am to 1am. Hands are swelled and Bruised. During this ride there is no water given out and we have to eat dry cheese sandwiches and dry swollow our medication. If we complain then our property comes up missing, The food is so bad that only 3 meals per week are edible. No fresh fruit or vegitables. DOCCS policy for a minor infraction is a Teir 1 but the staff are encourage to give out Teir 2 in order to collect the 5 dollar sur-charge and give a heavier penalty. Physical and verbal abuse are a problem especailly in mediums. No inmate wants to lose good time or lose a chance to go home, so many take the abuse. Grievance against officers never works! EVER!. Lastly, Medical Neglect: in 2015 I was due to go have wrist surgery (Minor) to correct a ingrown cyst. Due to me being transferred numereous times I had to start the whole doctor visits procedure all over at ecah facility. Now the outside surgeon told me that the long delay has caused this cyst to grow where now I have to have pieces of bone removed from my arm. So I know what medical neglect is...\n\nStatus Update: TY LETTER-DONE!	\N	2019-05-15	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

356	Padraic	Keating	97A0066	Bare Hill	Incarcerated Person	Letter	Mr. Keating is responding to CANY Re-engagment letter. However, Mr. Keating provided CANY with a list of concerns that are interesting: The privatizing of DOCCS, inch by inch, Jpay and Securus system now in service by DOCCS. This system now controls the inmate trust funds of DOCCS. The problem according to Mr. Keating is that Securus and JPay are not reputable companies. They have been sued in every state where they have been contracted. The rate fee charge by JPay would do a loan shark proud according to Mr. Keating In order to deposit monies in someones account the fee rates are as follow:  to deposit $0-$20 will cost on line  $3.15 and by phone $4.15. $21-100 with cost $6.15 on line and by phone $7.15. $100-$200 online $8.15 by phone $9.15. $200-$300 online $10.15 and by phone $11.15. The voice print system is a problem because there is no public protection for those who have no criminal record. This is called mining and when no one is informed this information could be sold to government agencies. Staff Relations: Simply look at the grievence system. Up till 2010 the binders containing such review, were four to six inch thick. The grievance system has been decimated into oblivion. Parole: One in four people in DOCCS custody are parole violators. This data is from DOCCS Fact Sheet 2016-2017. Early deportation for non-violent crimes. The Law written by the legislative branch, state in sum that any time after being received into the DOCCS a person can apply for early deportation or after half their sentence has been served. This is not being used.\n\nStatus Update: TY LETTER	\N	2019-05-14	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

We are removed from our programs after 3 years which makes DOCCS rehabilitation counter productive and only leads to further abuse by staff in so much that they can use us up, teach us nothing and toss us aside after three years. Stamps are 55 cent. The wages they pay us have never been raised  and the average inmate makes 16 to 26 cents an hour which means a inmate woiuld have to work 3 to 4 hours just to purchase stamps.\n\nStatus Update: TY LETTER	\N	2019-05-31	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

The SOP used to be on the first floor of the school building which made it more safe for the participants. There are still housing block clerks. A position that DOCCS abolished years ago. The clerks have access to inmates files and get this information in order to let others in the population know the criminal cases of sex offenders. This endangers everyone.

The staff here have tried to blame OMH for me being illegally held here and then when that back fired on them the security staff attempted another lie and say my tickets history and disciplinary is the reason I was brought here. But my classification has not chnaged from medium security. Since being here I have been stabbed by a known radical officer who has prior write ups. I reported this incident and I since been assaulted 3 times by co-workers of the CO that stabbed me. This is done out of retaliation for me filing grievances and writing to Albany, Supt. Capra, DSS Royce, Dep. Winship, Dep. Mastroieni, Dep Malin and Dep Henton, Capt. Barnes and Lt. Shere. I even wrote to the attorney general office as well as OSI, who mailed my complaint back to the facility and put my life in danger. I aske to be put in PC to no avail. Note: On 5/30/2019 John my neighbor in A-74 cell killed himself. I wrote 2 letters to OMH reporting his change of behavior, giving his property away, staying in his cell 24 hrs for the last two and half weeks.

Mr. Anderson is an admitted marijuana user. He admits to being addicted to marijuana and has sought treatment for his addiction but DOCCS told him "Because of my sentence 50 years to life I am not a priority for drug abuse treatment..." Mr. Anderson was given a disposition on 5/24/2019 for 30 days SHU time. During this time he is being packed up and transferred to SHU. However, he has property to be vouched and the property officer name CO James told Mr. Anderson he could not have his personal TV,lamp, food, bottled water etc. He was ordered to either destroy, donate or mail out the the items.  After a conversation with a Sgt. K. Montgomery Mr. Anderson says he reluctantly agreed to send the items home via vistor. After all of this Mr. Anderson alleges he was having a medical emergency. Chest pain and numbness on his left side. The sergeant and officers did not take Mr. Anderson medical issue seriously. He was accussed of faking his illness and when the staff enterred his cell he was lying face down and according to Mr. Anderson he was handcuffed and assaulted by CO Pawlowski. Mr. Anderson claims the staff had total disregard for his medical emergency. The CO's told the medical staff Mr. Anderson was faking because he could not have his property. On 5/30/2019 Mr. Anderson was given a misbehavior report for asking for medical. This is retaliation because of the beating. Mr. Anderson says he is afraid to file a greivance because he doesn't want to be assaulted again or set up.

492	Richard	Rivera	04B0408	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Letter	Mr. Rivera is writing from Attica responding to the Pre-Questionnaire CANY sent. Areas of concern are: Visiting Room Process: Families are waiting 1 to 2 hours for their visitors to come down. With the Noon count everything stops until the count clears. There are 2 visiting rooms at Attica but the facility only uses one. When the visiting room is over crowded the staff start requiring those who live within a 100 miles of the facility has to leave. This is done by the descrestion of the CO. Drug?Special Watch: Temporary Isolation. There are no mattress, pillow or linen in these units. Per Directive 4910 inmates are to received the above items whilke they are temporary in Observation Unit. These units are freezing cold and no hygenic items are provided: tooth brush, tooth paste, soap, hand towel. We are force to sleep on a steel bed! The Observation Unit was desgined for temporary isolation but is utilized as a torture chamber. Oversite is needed here. Urinalysis Testing: There seems to be a pattern at Attica of targeting men who parcipate in the FRP. Many of these men who have participated in the FRP for years are now being given misbehavior reports After they come off the FRP. You are to take a urinalysis prior to the FRP and right after. Its the Right After test that many are found to be tested positive for. Because we have to rely on the staff to follow the proper procedure and to be trust worthy its hard to defend against a tampering or false positive reading.

I want you to record this incident from 5-20-2019 in the morning when she, from the moment she entered the room, said she didn’t want me to speak Spanish. I feel discriminated against. I am asking that they give me every paper they hand out in group in Spanish. They are not offering me that right. What do we Hispanic people have here? There is not a single person here who translates for me. I want to express myself but no, I cannot because English is not my native language and I only know how to speak and understand a bit of English, with which I cannot adequately express myself. Please, I want them to give me a translator. Each time they put me in a meeting/appointment they ought to give me a translator. I do not want to keep signing documents which I do not understand. I have corrections and mental health counselors who do not speak my language and whom I do not understand because I do not speak English correctly.

667	Ian	Harewood	03B0334	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Letter	Mr. Harewood is responding to CANY Pre-Questionanire to Attica. Mr. Harewood starts off his response by stating: The Priamry problems ailing Attica is Nepotism. At Attica there are no more beatings of inmatews for sport by the officers due to cameras being installed, but haoever, there is a culture here of hatred for inmates that continues. There are fourth, fifth and even six generations of officers families who've worked at Attica Correctional Facility. When the new officers come in they are indoctrinated into the very same culture that have been pervasive for decades at the facility. All of the staff cover for each other because most officers have family members here who are captains, leutenants, sergeants, etc... So if an inmate makes a complaint the higher ups will more than likely ignore the complaint or do what they have to in order to protect that officer. Most of the supervisory staff at Attica were once CO's at Attica. Also higher ups are not respected by rank and file officers who have more seniority on the job than them. Senoir officers run the facility and any officer who is considered fair is called "Inmate lover." Another issue that is of concern are the process in which urine test are done. Since the assaults are down the new way officers are harassing inmates is through urine test, especially those who go on FRP.  The average number of people who were found guilty of a positive urine after the FRP was 3. Now the average is 14 people in three months!!! Obviously there is something wrong and no one from DOCCS wants to listen. Lastly, there is no diversity at Attica.\n\nStatus Update: TY LETTER	\N	2019-06-24	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Being in close proximity of an altercation when pepper spray is used adversly affects those who are non-participants in the altercation. So when this happens there is no policy for those who are non-participants in the altercation to seek help. Officers batons are unholstered in a aggressive and menacing manner at all times. If an inmate does not respond to a direct order regardless the reason it was commanded he will suffer dire consquences by more than one CO. Meaning you will be seriously subjected to a beat down that may leave you hospitalized, crippled or dead. Every 3 days here at Great Meadow someone gets cut or stabbed. Ninety nine percent of the cutting is gand related. For the record most inmates do not write to your association becasue they fear retailiation from the authorities.

1125	Kenneth E.	Scott	18B1490	Southport	Family	Letter	I am writing to you to express my grave concern for my son Kenneth W. Scott II’s (DIN #18B1490) safety and well-being while he is currently incarcerated in the New York State Prison system at Southport Correctional Facility. My son was transferred to Southport Friday, July 19, 2019 and since arriving he felt a need to reach out to me by way of mail expressing his fear of being seriously injured and/or murdered at the hands of the corrections officers in that prison. Kenneth has received threats of serious bodily harm and death by several officers on his arrival. He was asked to remove the eye patch from his eye that he has worn since his eye was injured in November 2017 at the hands of a correction officer in Rochester, NY. The officers then told my son if he does not hand over the eye patch, they will stop his trays for a week and turn off the water supply to his cell, so he is unable to drink water. Kenneth was also told that he would be beat while handcuffed and shackled in the shower. In addition, these officers stated that I (his mother) would never know what happened to him and there would be nothing I (his mother) can do about it. Kenneth has several documented disabilities which includes visual, hearing, learning, and mental health diagnosis including Schizoaffective Disorder, PTSD, prolonged Grief Disorder, and Anxiety, all of which is being negatively impacted in this environment as well as increases his risk for injury, harm, and danger at the hands of others. I implore your assistance with having him moved to a facility that is preferred for individuals with disabilities for his physical and mental health, safety, and well-being.	\N	\N	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1126	\N	\N	\N	Bare Hill	Incarcerated Person	Letter	Kenneth has been incarcerated since July of 2017, with an expected release date of July 2023. Kenneth is actively involved in a lawsuit against the Monroe County Jail where he was disfigured and lost his vision at the hands of a corrections officer (his attorney is Atty. James Napier - Rochester, NY and Atty. Tony Laduca - Rochester, NY). I fear this move was fueled by the prison guard’s knowledge regarding this lawsuit and is in retaliation to make my sons prison time extremely difficult. The thought that my son is purposely being placed in dangerous circumstances has laid heavily on my heart. I am frightened for his safety, and terrified that I may go visit my son and I will be turned away because the prison guards are trying to hide injuries suffered at the hands of the correction officers; or receive a call that my son is deceased (a call that is any mother’s worst nightmare – I am not unfamiliar with). Myself and my son have written several letters and made multiple phone calls requesting that my son’s physical, medical and psychological circumstances are evaluated, and he be transferred to an appropriate housing facility for the care of individuals with disabilities.	\N	\N	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Mr. Mosies says he was never called back to neither get it done or for any follow up. In fact according to Mr. Mosies the infection returned and Mr. Mosies got rid of it himself by pressuring the inflamed area and rupturing the infection itself and draining it. Although, Colonoscopy and physicals are done they are not automatic. All medications are generic and all surguries at done for the lowest cost.  Mr. Mosies makes mention of Pedro Cruz #05A2229 who died on November 21, 2018. He lost alot blood to the brain after a hemmorage from the liver in which he was being treated for many years, along with many medical conditions (Heart problems and Diabeties).

1397	Kenneth	Scott	18B1490	Southport	Incarcerated Person	Phone	This came in an email from Norvella Hill the mother of Kenneth Scott. I am writing to you to express my grave concern for my son Kenneth W. Scott II’s (DIN #18B1490) safety and well-being while he is currently incarcerated in the New York State Prison system at Southport Correctional Facility. My son was transferred to Southport Friday, July 19, 2019 and since arriving he felt a need to reach out to me by way of mail expressing his fear of being seriously injured and/or murdered at the hands of the corrections officers in that prison. Kenneth has received threats of serious bodily harm and death by several officers on his arrival. He was asked to remove the eye patch from his eye that he has worn since his eye was injured in November 2017 at the hands of a correction officer in Rochester, NY. The officers then told my son if he does not hand over the eye patch, they will stop his trays for a week and turn off the water supply to his cell, so he is unable to drink water. Kenneth was also told that he would be beat while handcuffed and shackled in the shower. In addition, these officers stated that I (his mother) would never know what happened to him and there would be nothing I (his mother) can do about it. Kenneth has several documented disabilities which includes visual, hearing, learning, and mental health diagnosis including Schizoaffective Disorder, PTSD, prolonged Grief Disorder, and Anxiety, all of which is being negatively impacted in this environment as well as increases his risk for injury, harm, and danger at the hands of others. I implore your assistance with having him moved to a facility that is preferred for individuals with disabilities for his physical and mental health, safety, and well-being.\n \nKenneth has been incarcerated since July of 2017, with an expected release date of July 2023. Kenneth is actively involved in a lawsuit against the Monroe County Jail where he was disfigured and lost his vision at the hands of a corrections officer (his attorney is Atty. James Napier - Rochester, NY and Atty. Tony Laduca - Rochester, NY). I fear this move was fueled by the prison guard’s knowledge regarding this lawsuit and is in retaliation to make my sons prison time extremely difficult. The thought that my son is purposely being placed in dangerous circumstances has laid heavily on my heart. I am frightened for his safety, and terrified that I may go visit my son and I will be turned away because the prison guards are trying to hide injuries suffered at the hands of the correction officers; or receive a call that my son is deceased (a call that is any mother’s worst nightmare – I am not unfamiliar with). Myself and my son have written several letters and made multiple phone calls requesting that my son’s physical, medical and psychological circumstances are evaluated, and he be transferred to an appropriate housing facility for the care of individuals with disabilities. Kenneth has filed several grievances, appeals, and complaints but he has not had any help or relief in getting assistance in getting the help that he needs.\n\nStatus Update: Esther for follow up.	\N	2019-08-21	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1398	Jermaine	Gotham	16D0032	Wende	Incarcerated Person	Email	Angela Morris is Jermaine mother and she has emailed me the following: Hi Mr.tyrrell we didnt get chance to speak other day to tell you about the rec &grievance issue. Weds usually in am they dont call rec for his block they claim they doing searches but be sitting talking or sleep. Yesterday Jermaine went to law library 2:30-4:30 or 5 they had them locked in till 825 called them to yard 830 for half hr. Think they go out 630 he said. Grievances the sergeant gets out box early am they be tossing the important ones out. And they dont give grievance papers to them either so he made his own. So when c.o. threatened him about helping hang him with sheet asking for omh he never got that hearing he hasn't seen that c.o. which that matter still needs be addressed was a sergeant also involved I believe.alot of grievances are gone when Jr got beat they got rid of them also. I dont think you gonna like what you see or hear when you go up. I believe I sent you info about c.o. Pittman an the other lady about my daughter an grandson. And about my 15 yr old son with autism laid his head on table. I told his lawyers about omh giving his Nighttime med clonidine at 3pm and he goes to yard like they setting him up get hurt that med knocks him out. He hasn't called me yet so that means they had them locked in again. He also asked to review his records also for omh. He has me signed so they call me I call them especially about med changes sum he has bad reactions to when they had dosed up on seroquel an thorazine when he was younger. They wont connect me to omh an guy never called me back the psychiatrist when he tried saying oh your son has been denying come down I said no he hasn't that's why I'm calling c.o. refusing him so hes like well he on a 72hr hold till I see him.i made sure he saw him next day I sure told him he wasnt gonna like it if I reached out to certain people.they think he sum dumb teen. He was a non believer when he was younger I told him about juvenile homes I been in so when he ended up in the places he new to speak on stuff that he knew what they was doing was wrong.he just older now and couple new ones tried him.other guard came an told new guy this young man right here you dont want to run your mouth too.if he telling you he not typical teenager and he locked in right now your best bet is to take his word an he told guy he causing conflict in his tier with guys he has to be around an I guess he one of the good ones.i know theres gotta be more.	\N	2019-08-21	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He verbally confronted them about it. They assaulted him. He stayed in the hospital for a week and then went to SHU for 60 days. He got only 60 days because each of the four officers gave a slightly different story. Initially, the nurses waited to write reports to let bruises go away. But he also suffered cuts under his eye and a broken foot. He said a sergeant told the COs not to turn the camera on. And the video was only turned on after the incident, when he was being taken downstairs.\n\nStatus Update: F/U Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1439	Dean	Manor	03B2799	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Release Date 2031. 11 months at Great Meadow. 17 years incarcerated so far. Said he was in SHU because C.O.s said they saw visitor pass him something. They didn't find drugs, but said they found two scalpel blades in the observation room that he was detained in. He says the C.O.s set him up.He says SHU is deterred from going to the one-hour recreation because it's early in the morning and SHU residents have to place their mattress and everything in their cells at the front of the gate in order to sign up for the rec list. Also, there is no announcement of the rec list. Staff just walk by early in the morning. Files grievances. All end in informal resolutions.\n\nStatus Update: F/U Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

1443	Aaron	Radford	17B0804	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	At GM for a year. Incarcerated for 3. Release date 2022.Has seen approximately 12 staff assaults against inmates at GM.Last summer he watched an inmate get beat up by C.O.s and that inmate went to the hospital and never came back.Some C.O.s enter cells and take stuff out of them without authorization. The "burn" is used all the timeLibrarian writes tickets for people who don’t show up for their call out. But if the C.O. put you on the burn, it isn't your fault. So you get a ticket for nothing and you can't fight it. When on the burn, you don't get food from messhall because you're not technically "keeplocked." Every ticket results in keeplock or SHU. The "reprimand" penalty is never used.People on the front half of a block can get to their callouts on time. But people on the back half of a block have to wait all the way until the yard run before they can get out of their cells for a callout. It takes away a lot of time. Sometimes you submit a sick call slip but don't get called until 7 days later. It's not always next day like it's supposed to be.Says Comstock is very bad.He mailed 7 letters at GM to his family; only 3 letters reached the destination. When he grieved it, the guards attacked him. Phone calls are frequently 5 minutes rather than 10 or 15, every other day. In the yard at night, C.O.s collect ID cards for the phone, but they keep mixing them up instead of doing first come, first serve. So it's possible for your ID card to keep getting pushed to the back and you never get to use the phone. Says at Wende C.F. in 2015 a C.O. attacked a visitor in the parking lot and broke the visitor's leg, and the C.O. didn't lose her job. Her name was C.O. L. Johnson.\n\nStatus Update: F/U Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

1485	Thomas	Smith	10R3959	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Thomas Smith is a 49 year old black male who was transferred from Upstate only eight days ago. He was also previously incarcerated in the Franklin facility for 3 ½ years.  Mr. Smith has served six years of a 3 ½ to seven-year prison term. His earliest release date is in May 2019, having previously lost his conditional release date because of a disciplinary infraction.     \n\nIn 2017, Mr. Smith was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer.  (Lung cancers are ranked on a scale of 1 to 4 based on the extent of the cancer’s growth and spread.  About a third of people diagnosed with lung cancer have stage 3 cancers, which is often considered past the point at which surgical intervention is a viable treatment option.)  Mr. Smith said he filed a 1983 action against the medical staff at Franklin for inserting a chemotherapy port into his body after he had refused the treatment.  \n\nMr. Smith said he has “no complaints” about Great Meadow because, as he put it, he “just got here.”  After filing a grievance against a nurse at Franklin, however, Mr. Smith said he had been the victim of retaliation. He said he was sent to special housing for 90 days because a urinalysis showed marijuana in his system.\n\nStatus Update: F/U Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

1616	Nelson	Polanco	03A0259	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Nelson Polanco is a 37 year-old Hispanic male serving a 40-year sentence for an offense that he was convicted of committing at age 19. He is ineligible for release until 2036, two days before his 54th birthday.  He has been incarcerated at Great Meadow since 2003. \n\nMr. Polanco is housed in Block E-8, the so-called honor housing, which is separated from the general population and in which occupants enjoy more privileges, such as an outside view and marginally more commodious accommodations than the 6’ x 9’ cells in which other inmates are housed.  The corrections department uses honor housing as an incentive for good behavior. The practical consequence of segregating inmates based on behavior is that the honor housing populations tends to skew older than the general population because older inmates have matured and learned how to avoid the behaviors, circumstances and responses that plague younger inmates with multiple rule infractions and poor disciplinary records. As another inmate observed, Mr.  Polanco said honor housing has had the unintended effect of removing from the general population older, more mature inmates who might serve as role models and guide younger inmates on how to comport themselves to decrease incidences of disciplinary tickets.  \n\nMr. Polanco also observed that the “young guys have no incentive to behave” because of the over-emphasis on discipline and the frequency with which guards “take stuff away from them” arbitrarily for minor, and often manufactured, rule infractions.  He bemoaned the demise programs, like furloughs, that previously existed and served as incentives and to morale boosters.  \n\nIn the 2015, the U.S. Department of Education chose Bennington College as a participant in a pilot program to offer college level classes at Great Meadow.  Bennington is a private liberal arts school in Vermont about an hour’s drive south of the prison.  Once enrolled, inmates study literature, American history and politics and earn credits toward a college degree, which they can pursue if transferred to a prison offering a degree program, like the Bard Prison Initiative in six other prisons in New York State.   \n\nMr. Poloano ‎applied to participate in Bennington’s pilot program. He wrote the required admissions essay and, after surviving Great Meadow's screening to weed out inmates with disciplinary issues, he was interviewed by the college and admitted into the program.  Mr. Polanco enrolled and matriculated for three consecutive semesters but dropped out because of unrelenting harassment by disapproving guards, choosing to forgo an education rather than to continue incurring the guards’ wrath.  \n\nOf the inmates interviewed, Mr. Polanco was by far the most conspicuously self-conscious of the prison administrator—in this instance the Superintendent—lurking within earshot of our conversation.  As he spoke, Mr. Polanco’s eyes darted furtively between me and the Superintendent, and he appeared fearful of being overheard.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1617	Raymond	Rosario	94A8306	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Raymond Rosario is a 42 year-old Hispanic male who has served 25 years of a 26 ½ years to life sentence.  Mr. Rosario transferred from Woodburne, one of the medium security facilities in the Hudson Valley region, to Great Meadow two years ago. This is his third stint at Great Meadow for a total of five years of incarceration here.  \n\nMr. Rosario is eligible for parole on March 22, 2021, and will be making an initial parole board appearance in November 2020.  Mr. Rosario said he is awaiting enrollment in mandatory MRT and ASAT programs, and has applied to transfer to a medium security facility closer to his family in NYC.  He applied to transfer eight months ago and has as yet received no response.  In the meantime, he has instructed his family not to visit him at Great Meadow because the long commute is an extreme hardship on them. He expressed no other misgivings or complaints about Great Meadow, perhaps because after 25 years of incarceration he is on the cusp of possibly being released. \n\nMr. Rosario is amenable to follow-up, including being surveyed and interviewed.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1618	Benjamin	Marcial	16A5201	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Benjamin Marcial is a 47 year-old Hispanic male who has served two years of a 32 years to life sentence at Great Meadow.  He was previously incarcerated at Attica, Clinton, Elmira and the Albion correctional facilities.  Since last November, Mr. Marcial has been waiting for a good behavior transfer to the Green Haven facility closer to NYC.  His initial parole hearing date is September 2046 and earliest release date is in 2047. \n \nWhen asked about conditions at Great Meadow, he complained that the guards “don’t respect us” and are indifferent to inmates’ suffering, pointing out the cell block’s closed windows despite the stifling heat inside even as CANY’s inspection was underway. Mr. Marcial said he has completed all mandatory programs he is required to take but can’t get treatment because inmates with earlier release dates are given priority ahead of him. He noted that an inmate in a neighboring cell has been waiting eight days for an escort to simply retrieve a package his family had sent him.  \n\nMr. Marcial denounced the prison administrators as “clueless” about the conditions afflicting Great Meadow’s inmates, noting that administrators aren’t at the facility on weekends and during weekdays  “don’t do rounds.”  He observed that, as a training facility, Great Meadow has a higher proportion of young, inexperienced guards than other prisons. This, coupled with an influx of young inmates, results in an environment strained by impulsive and aggressive behaviors characteristic of young adults when confronted with real or perceived threats, provocations or frustrations. \n\nMr. Marcial is amenable to follow-up, including being surveyed and interviewed.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

1619	Alex	Gonzalez	15B2863	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Alex Gonzales is a 23 year-old Hispanic male who was sentenced in September 2015 to serve a prison term of nine years. When Mr. Gonzales was initially incarcerated, he was eligible for parole in November 2022.  He has since been convicted on new charges that increased his term of incarceration by three years, making his earliest parole date in September 2025.  Mr. Gonzales said he has been incarcerated at Great Meadow since December 2018, and before that Marcy for two years and Attica for a year.  Mr. Gonzales complained that, while incarcerated at Attica, he lost his gallbladder after being starved for 6 ½ days.  \n\nMr. Gonzales said the guards at Great Meadow thrive on “intimidation” as a control tactic.  By way of example, according to Mr. Gonzales, when new inmates arrive, guards make a provocative speech threatening physical violence against them: “If you talk to our females, we break your bones.  If you get out of line, we break your bones.  If you break the rules, we break your bones.”  In relaying this, Mr. Gonzales moved closer to the steel bars between us, and his body language suggested he is not easily intimidated and, by the same stroke, showing unwittingly how easily provoked he can be.  \n\nMr. Gonzales is amenable to follow-up, including being surveyed and interviewed.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1620	Albert	Anderson	11R1308	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Albert Anderson is a 56 year-old black male who has served eight years of a 20 years to life sentence.  He was incarcerated at Green Haven for a year before being transferred to Great Meadow in 2012.  His earliest release date is 2020, when he will be 67 years old. \n\nMr. Anderson complained about a noxious brew of erratic and capricious prison rules, blatantly dishonest guards who manufacture fictitious infractions, and arbitrary hearing officers who mete out harsh punishment for relatively minor rule violations. To illustrate his point, Mr. Anderson relayed the travails leading to a 15-day disciplinary keeplock order after he injured his back from  a slip and fall in the mess hall.  Mr. Anderson obtained authorization for an extra mattress to alleviate the suffering he would have to endure sleeping on a steel frame bed covered only by the razor-thinly-constructed, standard-issued prison mattress.  \n\nA guard later accused Mr. Anderson of having a contraband mattress. When Mr. Anderson showed the guard his permit for it, the guard claimed the permit was counterfeited and ticketed him 30 days in disciplinary keeplock.  (Mr. Anderson admits the permit had recently expired and he had not yet renewed it.)  At the subsequent disciplinary hearing, the hearing officers rejected the counterfeit charge against Mr. Anderson,  found him “not guilty” of having a contraband mattress yet still sentenced him to 15 days in disciplinary keeplock. \n\nMr. Anderson, who had culinary experience on the outside, was earning the top rate $0.38 per hour at his job in the mess hall. As a result of 15-day disciplinary keeplock, Mr. Anderson believes he has lost the job; and fears, even if he is able to regain it after serving his keeplock sentence, he will be forced to accept the starting rate of $0.16 per hour.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1621	Adiljan	Anarbaev	17A4936	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Adiljan Anarbaev is a 50 year-old male of Russian descent who is serving 33 ½ years to life sentence.  He has been incarcerated at Great Meadow since December 2017. \n\nAccording to public sources, a year after fatally stabbing his estranged wife, Mr Anarbaev was found mentally unfit to stand trial and remanded to an upstate psychiatric facility for treatment and evaluation. Mr Anarbaev, who also turned the knife on himself, believed his wife was possessed by demons and that an “energy told him to stab everybody”. When officers responded to the disturbance, Mr Anarbaev’s wife was dead and he was lying on the floor unresponsive and bleeding with two knives protruding from his body.   \n\nAccording to Mr. Anarbaev, when he killed his wife he was suffering from a severe bout of depression. Four years after the stabbing, however, a judge found him fit to stand trial, rejected his extreme emotional disturbance defense and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment from which he cannot be released until September 2046, at which point he will be 77 years old. \n\nIn lieu of psychotropic medicine and therapy to treat his mental illness, Mr Anarbaev seemed to be relying primarily on a regimen of exercise, diet and eastern philosophical readings.  Mr Anarbaev spoke English poorly (during his trial he used a Russian interpreter), so I could not discern whether he had access to—or even sought to avail himself of—the prison’s mental health services during his term of disciplinary lockdown.  Mr Anarbaev said he disliked the side effects of the medications prescribed to him, having concluded they are unnecessary unless he senses the onset of a bout of depression.  He also said he preferred the writings of an eastern philosopher (whose identity could not be discerned because the book he gesticulated about was written in Russian) to talk therapy.  \n\nMr. Anarbaev said he is being unfairly disciplined because a guard trumped-up a false assault claim against him. When Mr. Anarbaev complained about the guard confiscating his television, he was told to “shut the fuck up.”  He was given 45 days in the box, having plead guilty rather than confront provocative and dishonest guards.  Mr. Anarbaev’s sister has sent $200 for him to purchase a new television, but he fears guards will take that one too.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
1622	Charles	Hamilton	15A4245	Great Meadow	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Charles Hamilton is a 56 year-old black male serving a 20 years to life sentence for robbery and assault.  His earliest parole date is in March 2034, when he will be 71 years old.  He was incarcerated at Upstate for 18 months, and 10 months ago transferred to Great Meadow. \n\nMr. Hamilton described himself as the prison’s facilitator for the Nation of Islam. When asked about conditions and the treatment of inmates at Great Meadow, he characterized the guards as “very aggressive with [the prison’s] young” inmate population.  He went on to hypothesize that, in light of falling crime statistics and the growing clamor for criminal justice reform, correction officers are pushing back “to justify why we still need prisons.”  Mr. Hamilton said he’s amendable to a follow-up visit or interview.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He is serving a sentence of 50 years to life. He is ineligible for parole until 2030, when he will be 73 years old.  After serving time at Attica, Green Haven, Clinton, and nearly a decade at a medium security facility, Mr. Pacheco asked to be transferred to Great Meadow to be closer to his sister. \n\nMr. Pacheco identified the relative youth of guards and new inmates as the source of Great Meadow’s most combustible problems.  He also lamented the prison’s loss of older, more experienced guards from attrition and retirement and the loss of discontinued programs that were outlets to occupy inmates’ time, to boost their morale and that served as incentives for good behavior.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He previously served time at Five Points and was transferred to Great Meadow in January 2019. His earliest release date is in November 2019. \n\nMr. Williford complained that inmates at Great Meadow are being “deprived of rehabilitation” because the facility is a “disciple jail.”  He believes he was sent to Great Meadow as retaliation for filing a lawsuit against corrections officials.  He claims he has been improperly denied FOIL information and put in protective custody without being ticketed.  He says he does not venture outside because he is 11 days from completing the alcohol and substance abuse program and believes he is being targeted is some fashion.  \n\nMr. Williford says he is bipolar and suffers from depression and PTSD, for which he is being medicated but not receiving therapy.  Mr Williford is amenable to follow-up, including being surveyed and interviewed.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He was transferred from the Downstate facility to Great Meadow a couple of weeks ago (March 7).  Mr. Ligon’s parole hearing date is in August 2019 and his earliest release date is in March 2020.  \n\nMr. Ligon complained that his early release is conditioned on completing a “judge- mandated” Shock program.  He believes he was transferred to Great Meadow to prevent him from completing the program to force him to serve the maximum sentence.  According to the program requirements, however, Mr. Ligon does not appear to qualify for Shock because he’s over the 35-year-old age cut-off and was convicted of committing a violent offense (criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree). Also, according to corrections’ description of the qualifications, judges can’t sentence offenders to Shock incarceration. \n\nMr. Ligon is eager for follow-up.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He was previously incarcerated at Clinton and transferred to Great Meadow in August 2017.  His earliest release date is December 2024. \n\nMr. Gilmore said he recently wrote CANY complaining about problems he was experiencing with legal and medical records disappearing and being opened by prison officials.  Mr. Gilmore claimed he has seen charts listing mail directed to him that he has not received.  He said he has two pro se lawsuits pending against corrections officials and has filed multiple grievances about problems with his mail.  \n\nMr. Gilmore said after suffering an injury he was classified as needing Mental Health Services Level 1. But he refuses to speak to Great Meadow’s mental health staff because some guards and nurses are related and, he believes, nurses on the mental staff are trying to get him to make “self-incriminating” statements, by which he appeared to mean statements adverse to the claims he’s making in his lawsuits and grievances against guards.  Mr. Gilmore was also previously incarcerated at Coxsackie and expressed concern that Great Meadow’s current Superintendent was formerly the Superintendent at Coxsackie.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He had just arrived at Great Meadow the week before CANY visit, but had previously served time at the Attica, Southport, Clinton, Five Points and Upstate facilities. \n\nMr. Siler is housed in Great Meadow’s special housing unit, where inmates’ rights to make phone calls, receive visitors, participate in programs, and interact with other inmates are curtailed and limited to the legally-mandated one-hour-a-day of recreation in an empty outdoor cage.  Mr. Siler said he also served time in the box at Five Points and Upstate.  Since February 2018, he has been housed in a special housing unit for all but two months.  Mr. Siler claimed that all of the disciplinary tickets that have landed him in special housing were for conduct precipitated by the guards.  He characterized Great Meadow as “brutal.” \n\nMr. Siler said he is amenable to follow-up, including being surveyed and interviewed.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Mr. Jones was only recently transferred to Great Meadow (in January 3, 2019), having previously served time at Coxsackie and multiple medium security facilities—Bare Hill, Gawanda, Mid-State, Riverview, Orleans and Washington.  \n\nAfter being transferred to Coxsackie in April 2017, Mr. Jones sued the facility for injuries he sustained while incarcerated in the special housing unit there.  Mr. Jones said he received good time credits for completing a mandatory program at Coxsackie, and would have been released on March 12, 2019 but the Time Allowance Committee unfairly used an old disciplinary infraction against him to change his release date.  Mr. Jones said he is preparing an Article 78 petition seeking to have the decision reversed.\n\n He also said he has complained to the Superintendent and Albany about medical attention he requires but has not received.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He was previously housed for 18 months in Green Haven, and before that in other maximum security facilities—Clinton, Attica, Auburn and Elmira.  \n\nAs a recent arrival, Mr. Cartledge has experienced nothing relevant to relate and expressed nothing negative or positive about Great Meadow, except his early impression of Great Meadow as being “better than Green Haven”.  He characterized Green Haven as infested with “satanic, homosexual male officers”, which I interpreted to mean guards who routinely raped inmates.    \n\nMr. Cartledge said he has a relatively clean disciplinary record, having avoided disciplinary infractions since 2014, except for a ticket he caught 16 days after arriving at Green Haven that landed him in the special housing unit for 51 days.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He complained that the tickets he caught from guards landing him in special housing “make no sense”.   He refused, however, to contest them because, in route to a hearing, guards would force him to walk through the general population with his hands manacled, leaving him exposed to other inmates and with no means of protecting himself from bodily harm.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-03-26	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

1687	Marcus	Barber	09B3531	Shawangunk	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Marcus Barber is a 30-year-old Black male who has served 11 of a 20-year sentence.  His earliest release date is January 2026.  \n\nMr. Barber said he has been incarcerated at many of the state’s prison facilities but rated Shawangunk as, in many respects, the “best” facility in which he’s been imprisoned.  But he complained bitterly about the unfair and frightening circumstances that landed him in the Special Housing Unit.  \n\nMr. Barber is a practicing Muslim and claims he was targeted for harassment and is being punished by a corrections officer based on Mr. Barber’s religious beliefs.  According to Mr. Barber, while in route to the E-Block’s recreational yard he was subject to a random search, with which he complied.  accosted by a corrections officer, who he identified as “H. Lawrence.”  Afterwards, while gathering his belongings, Mr. Barber claims Officer Lawrence yanked a Quran from him and asked “are you a militant” and demanded to know “is this Quran the book that has all that militant stuff in it?”  \n\nMuslim’s consider the Quran, their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad.  Officer Lawrence apparently didn’t understand he was not holding the Quran, but, rather, a copy of al-Nawawī’s book “The Forty Hadith.”  Iman al-Nawawī was a noted academic and author of numerous scholarly works on theology, biography, jurisprudence and hadith (which is the record of the Prophet Muhammad’s words and deeds).   \n\nMr. Barber was confused and said he didn’t know what officer Lawrence was talking about.  As officer Lawrence became increasingly agitated by Mr. Barber’s confusion, he shouted “well is it?!!!” Is it?!!!  Answer me!” Mr. Barber said he feared he was about to be “attacked because I am Muslim.”  When he was able to finally muster a response, Mr. Barber asked what the problem was and why he was being harassed.  According to Mr. Barber, Officer Lawrence replied “I want to know if this is that militant book!” and then instructed Mr. Barber to get on the wall and ordered that he to be taken back to his housing unit.  \n\nMr. Barber saw officer Lawrence’s rant as an obvious display of racism and Islamophobia, which was witnessed—in plain view and with apparent approval—by an area sergeant and other officers.  Subsequently, Mr. Barber claims he was falsely accused of having “threatened a corrections officer” and placed on keeplock, which, he says, is the first disciplinary ticket he’s ever received. \n\nMr. Barber said the incident left him reluctant to openly practice his religious beliefs out of fear of provoking verbal abuse, physical assault and ill-treatment from DOC personnel, who, in Mr. Barber’s eyes, appear to harbor negative, preconceived ideas about and hatred of Muslims.  Citing the recent Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, in which 51 people were killed, and mosque burnings in the U.S, Mr. Barber’s fear of a “growing threat” of Islamophobia seems entirely justified.   Mr. Barber has lodged these concerns with Governor Cuomo, the Daily News, and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and provided CA with a copy of his communication to Governor Cuomo.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-05-07	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He said the facility is often poorly- or un-heated, inmates lack any privacy whatsoever, even for the most basic of human needs, and that corrections officers routinely write-up inmates for petty infractions.  If, for example, an inmate makes a crude accommodation, like hanging a bed sheet against the bars to afford a modicum of privacy while he relieves himself in the steel toilet affixed to the concrete wall of his 6’ x 9’ cell, he is given a disciplinary ticket by corrections officers.  He said the younger, less experienced corrections officer were by far the “worse” offenders.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-05-07	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He has been incarcerated at Shawangunk for 10 years, and previously was in Great Meadow, Green Haven, Wende and Sing Sing. \n\nMr. Ward’s sole complaint—his perhaps obvious and understandable obsession, really—concerns a 25-year quest to obtain records of a female inmate and co-defendant that he claims was sent into the prison wearing a wire in an ill-fated attempt to elicit and record a confession from him.  The circumstances apparently piqued Mr. Ward’s suspicion because, under Department of Corrections’ policy, one co-defendant is normally not admitted into a prison facility to visit another.  In any event, Mr. Ward said he didn’t talk to his co-defendant “because she was trying to incriminate me.”  Mr. Ward claims the Department of Corrections acknowledged the female co-defendant was inside the prison facility but claims she was on Mr. Ward’s “negative contact list”, thus presumably taking the position that see was not there to see him.  I had difficulty grasping the point of Mr. Ward’s concerns, inasmuch as the visit did not result in him having made statements that were or could be used against him.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-05-07	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

His earliest parole date is April 2024.  Mr. Minto has been incarcerated at Shawangunk since October 2017, and has previously served time at the Sing Sing, Attica, Auburn and Clinton facilities.  \n\nMr. Minton is a cancer survivor on the 10-year watch list.  He had his last of three surgeries in late 2018.  He was admitted for three months at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie, NY where a cancerous tumor was removed from his thymus gland, the small organ responsible for the production of white blood cells that helps the immune system fight off illness.  Mr. Minto underwent chemo-therapy for several months, and finished radiation therapy in early 2019. Oncologists saw no signs of the tumor at his last examination, and put him on a 10-year watch list. \n\nMr. Minton complained about undue barriers the Superintendent erected that prevented family members in Mr. Minton’s life from participating in his health care process.  His wife was given latitude to visit him but visits by his brother and sister were restricted to family visiting hours.    \n\nMr. Minton also complained about the unjust suspension of his visitation rights because an old misbehavior report improperly hangs over his head.  Mr. Minton was given a misbehavior report in May 2017 because corrections officers discovered marihuana in his former wife’s purse when she was being screened for a visit with him.  As a result, Mr. Minton lost all visitation rights.  In December 2017, the loss of visitation order was vacated in an Article 78 proceeding that Mr. Minton filed, and corrections was ordered to conduct a new hearing by May 11, 2018.  To date, no re-hearing has been held, and Mr. Minton continues to be denied conjugal visitation rights because of the misbehavior report still on his records.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-05-07	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He said the prior Superintendent had increased the availability of programs at Shawangunk but the current administration has reduced them with the Tier System.

His earliest release date is August 2037. \nMr. Patterson was 30 years old when he began his term of incarceration and will be 72 by the time he’s elible for parole. \n\nMr. Redd said the morale of correction officers and inmates has declined significantly since the arrival of the new Superintendent.  The inmates see many of the new rules the Supreintendent has imposed as irrational—needlessly changing procedures that adversely effect inmates with little or no increase in security or safety; and depriving inmates of benefits without offseting rewards.  For example, under new procedures for screening visitors, corrections officers have allowed cannine dogs to put their snouts near visitors‘ private parts, which inmates see as needlessly degrading.  Mr. Redd also complained about the imposition of new restrictions on telephone usage, dimissing as pretext the rationale that gangs control the telephones.  He claims this is easily refutted because correction officers are assigned to monitor phone usage and each outgoing call is loggged.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-05-07	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Mr. Pugh claims his disciplinary record is clean, except for a “few petty things”.  He said his strategy before parole boards is “to stay humble.”  By Mr. Pugh’s account, though, commissioners have used racial slurs and made other degrading remarks to him, which he interpreted as crude attempts to provoke him.  During a parole hearing at Sing Sing, for example, commissioners hurled racial slurs and taunted Mr. Pugh with provocative statements like “your mother shouldn’t have had you” and “why did you victimize white people; why not black people”?\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-05-07	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He said he’s otherwise programmed out because he is educated and does not need the kinds of remedial, vocational and skill trades available at Shawangunk.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-05-07	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Finally, he also discussed problems with conditions - no hot water in cells, no radio or TV or tablet, and birds flying into cells and eating.	\N	2019-07-16	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Says big problem is lack of programming in IPC as well as packages, where random items get taken away from random reasons (usually "concern for your safety"), and in IPC you can't see your packages so you can't dispute it.	\N	2019-07-16	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He also described medical care as horrendous, explaining that he received no accomodations, including those he received at other facilities such as a flats pass and a shower permit. He named Dr. Geer as an issue. Auburn is very inacessible, as the second floor of the facilities is made equivalent to the first, but there are flights of stairs to take to reach ground level as well as to enter the mess hall. Gross does believe the food has gotten better in the past 3months. His cell does not have roaches, but only because he paid (he says unfairly) for many repellants. The wall has not worked since January, limiting their access to radio to old versions with antennae. Even these however do not work with older lights that block the radio signal. he believes the facility has improved with the hiring of younger, more professional COs and a better superintendant.	\N	2019-07-16	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

The dentist slipped and the grinder burned his face. The dentist was visiting from Attica.

1851	Crushawn	Hundley	12A3910	Auburn	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Has spent 13 months in ICP; there is no orientation manual for IPC procedures or to know who the ICP staff is. Without an orientation manual for ICP, no one knows who to contact in various situations. ICP gets a very reduced rate of pay; it used to be double what it is now. ICP inmates do not get preference transfers like all the rest of the inmates at a facility; he suffers from manic depression and frequently cannot sleep at night, so he falls asleep early in the morning. When the medication nurses walk by, most of them will wake him up to ensure he gets his medication, but there is one nurse who does not wake him up and will walk by him even though he's not supposed to skip any of his medication. He doesn't know the nurse's name, but she worked the day before the CANY visit at 7:15 AM on his gallery for medication. He grieved this nurse and the fact that she skips him during medication even though she knows his issue, but grievance didn't reply and just forwarded the complaint to the OMH Unit Chief who never responded. The grievance number is AUB-75818-19 and the reply was dated March 8, 2019.\n\nStatus Update: DOCCS F/U	\N	2019-07-16	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Finally, states that if you sign up for rec, you cannot sign up for phones even if rec is canceled (which main and back yard rec often are).	\N	2019-07-18	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

Says that this causes a lot of violence, because the majority of violence happens within cellmates and Cos encourage this and are not helpful in de-escalation. Says there is retaliation by COs through cutting off the phone and rec - they often cut off a whole block just for one incident. The COs also often claim that the porches=rec. Finally, mentions a lot of theft in the package room, particularly by the female officer (married to captain so a lot of freedom).	\N	2019-07-18	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He has complained about the switch but nothing has come about the complaint.

Also states that the admin do not allow the ILC to do their jobs - admin spends their funding and then covers it up, as "money just disappears" - admin control the paperwork so there is no accountability. This causes many to quit because they are not able to do anything.	\N	2019-07-18	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2010	Terry	Golden	00A6753	Five Points	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Says he recently got a ticket for "creating a disturbance," "harrassment," "phone violation," "refusing a direct order" and it was undeserved - he was on the phone with his mom and told to get off for no reason - got a ticket for reacting to a bad order.	\N	2019-07-18	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

They also reported that serious medical issues were not met in timely ways, and that RNs within medical got in arguments amongst themselves. They say vocational and educational needs are being addressed, but that there is not enough programming to adjust the youngest population between the ages of 17 and 21.

He says that COs do not follow their own rules, and that cell standards are too restrictive, specifically in regards to hanging items.

2063	Osiris	Foulks	14A3482	Five Points	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Foulks and his bunkmate Rashawn Johnson find that COs launch investigations for no cause, handing out tickets indiscriminately and taking away chow. They say that the grievance process is practically non-existant. They also say that people sent to the box indiscriminately. They say that officers have romantic relationships with higher-ups, making reporting difficult. If one faces an issue and the gallery officer does not care, then one has to yell loudly through the door, which often results in a ticket, los of ASAT, and loss of parole. They also take issue with the fact that there is no lifer program. They showed me a medical grievance where the hearing date was 2 years later after the grievance was filed. They do get their medication on time. They also took issue with the fact that Five Points is the only max without any organizations.	\N	2019-07-18	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

The nurse said he refused the test before, but he said he didn't refuse it. The feedup hatch was very dirty and the nurse wanted him to stick his arm through it so she could use the needle. He wanted to clean the feedup hatch first before putting his arm through it, but the nurse walked away and said he refused. He is a member of the crips, and the facility gave him a cellmate who is a member of the bloods, and the facility knew their affiliations but did it anyway. He said he and the other were able to talk and not fight and then two weeks later the other guy was moved to a different cell, but it was a dangerous situation because the facility doesn't screen properly before moving people together. His toilet stopped working the day before the CANY visit; he told the CO but was still waiting for the plumber. Mail delivery is inconsistent and delayed. He can get a letter postmarked the 14th today, and then next week receive a letter from the same person that was postmarked the 8th.\n\nStatus Update: TY Letter	\N	2019-07-18	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2290	Loren	Dawson	17A2964	Five Points	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	He is serving a 12 year sentence (has spent time in SHU) and his most pervasive problem at Five Points are grievances. He said he has filed countless grievances about the package room woman to IGRC named Mandy Shultz who is married to a CO. Everytime it seems as though his grievances disappear and IGRC acts like they never received them. He also noted that Liutenant Smithers is aware of the greivances against Shultz, but has never done anything about it. He further stated that since he began writing grievances his packages have stopped being returned to his wife. In terms of other problems Dawson noted that the double cells have no privacy (especially in terms of the bathroom), transfers to other facilites are extremely delayed, there is an abuse of power/corruption (noted PREA) and cameras in the housing blocks do not capture everything.\n\nStatus Update: F/U Letter	\N	2019-07-18	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2343	Jahlon	Ingram	18A2099	Southport	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Five officers assaulted him the morning of CANY's visit. He was in D-1-3 cell in the morning and then moved to D-1-8. He said 5 C.O.s, a sergeant and a lieutenant beat him up, slammed him on the ground, kicked and punched him, and one person repeatedly stabbed his eye with something.This was all done to him while he was shackled. His hand is possibly broken, his left eye was swollen shut and bruised, and his face was full of scratches and red marks. His wrists and ankles had indentations from the shackles. The facility, at least on that day, was depriving him of food, clothing, bedding, and they put him on a water deprivation, so he can't flush the toilet or use the sink. He can't write letters or file a grievance because no one will give him paper or a pen. He is possibly on the MHU caseload; he told me he attempted suicided by hanging in the midstate SHU on 4/21/19. When medical staff walked past his cell after he was attacked by officers, he tried to get medical attention. The medical staff told him that they have nothing for him and continued to walk away. His mother's name is Tammy Ingram, and her phone number is 518-530-0453. He asked that we call her to tell her what happened to him because he has no paper to write to her. He named C.O. Toby as one of the officers who attacked him that morning. I spoke to DOCCS counsel David Harvey about the incident, and he told me that he would have Kathy (DOCCS counsel) review the SHU video tape. The superintendent told me that the officers did react physically to Mr. Jahlon because Mr. Jahlon spit blood into the face of a sergeant that morning.	\N	2019-08-15	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2351	Anthony	Sanders	17A5184	Southport	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	CO Brinks makes threats, does unauthorized cell searches while inmates are showering, and harrasses everyone. He also delays people's mail. He said he asked for help from OMH and they won't let him talk to anyone.

2353	Carlos	Garcia	89T1556	Southport	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	CO Brink is problematic; he reads everyone's legal material in their cells and looks for personal case information and any legal work that has DOCCS as a defendant. Mr. Garcia explained that while he was at Auburn, a CO sprayed a fire extinguisher into his cell twice. The CO got fired and he feels CO Brinks is retaliating against him because of that and because of the lawsuit he filed based on that incident. He has received multiple tickets from CO Brinks based on gang material because the CO interprets everything he reads as gang material, even when it's not. He said Sergeant Belz always supports CO Brink.	\N	2019-08-15	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2384	Noel	Rosario	12A4576	Elmira	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	The medical staff is disrepectful and not professional. Rosario has COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) which means his lungs shut down and he needs steroid shots and asthma pumps for treatment but is often afraid to seek medical attention because of the way he is treated.

Mr. Slater has been incarcerated at Elmira for 8 years. While he believes the conditions and administration at Elmira are better than at the Comstock, Attica and Clinton facilities where he has previously served time, he voiced concerns about the guards’ poor treatment of visitors and their mishandling of inmate packages. He complained that family visits are cut short by the inordinate amount of time (two hours or more) it takes them to clear security. The prison recently dropped its policy of limiting inmates to receiving two packages per month. Now that there is no limit on the number of packages inmates can receive, the system appears to be underresourced and overwhelmed. Although there are only two telephones for 54 inmates in Mr. Slater’s housing block, personally he has not experienced problems getting reasonable access to the telephones. Nor is he aware of problems with the medical services at Elmira and has had no direct contact with Dr. Ott.	\N	2019-08-17	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He served on the ILC as facilitator for Muslim inmates and voiced a litany of complaints about Elmira, including that the ILC had failed to accomplish anything. He complained that Dr. Ott runs the medical services like he’s the medical director of an athletic program, and often his treatments are grossly insufficient. For example, Mr. Scott claimed that for sleep apnea, Dr. Ott gave him a mouth guard used in sports. (According to WebMD, the oral appliances for mild cases of sleep apnea are similar in appearance to the mouth guards used in sports.)...Mr. Scott also pointed out the lack of ventilation in his housing block, which I observed to be a consistent pattern throughout the prison: air is circulated by fans, sometime multiple fans, in the guard areas at the end of the housing blocks. I did not observe a single fan, however, along the main housing block corridors and the air in those area was static. Fans are clearly and consistently provided solely for the benefit and comfort of correction officers.	\N	2019-08-17	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He is ineligible for release until 2035.\nMr. Jones complained about the limited availability of programming at Attica. According to Mr. Jones, he has been at Attica for approximately one and one-half years. He said he was previously incarcerated at Sing Sing, Five Points, Upstate, Clinton and Rikers (from 2012-2015). In that time, he obtained a high school equivalency diploma, and currently is on a waiting list for vocational training. He also said he wants to enroll in aggression replacement training (“ART”) but is barred because only inmates within three months of their release date can be accommodated in the program. He spends most days locked in his cell reading because of the extreme “limits” that Attica imposes on inmate movement.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2976	Carine	Reeves	18A3304	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Carine Reeves, a 39-year-old black male, has served one year of a 17- to 20-year sentence. He is ineligible for release until 2035.\nMr. Reeves complained that the limited number of and the process for managing inmates’ access to the telephones constrains his ability to maintain contact with his family. He said that a bank of nine telephones are located in the yard for use by inmates in his company. Inmates are only given access to those telephones during the block’s allocated recreation period, some of which is consumed by the amount of time the correction officers take moving the inmates on and off the block to the yard. In the yard, inmates put their identification cards in a bucket and a corrections officer picks nine names for successive turns using the phones. The amount of time each group is allowed is determined by the total number of inmates seeking to use the telephones. DOCCs directive No. 4423 allows 30-minute calls, but calls can be limited to ten minutes when other inmates are waiting.1 Mr. Reeves said calls are sometimes even shorter.\nMr. Reeves said he spends his time mostly reading on his own and doesn’t participate in programs because he doesn’t believe he will derive any benefits from them. He said he signed up for general business but was instead assigned to electrical. He said he signed himself out of electrical, which caused him to forfeit rights to a preference transfer to another facility, because, according to Mr. Reeves, the instructor has never given an inmate an apprenticeship certificate. Assuming its true, It’s not clear what this means. According to DOCCs, a “NYS Department of Labor Apprenticeship Program” is available at Attica.2 But, apprenticeship is the process of learning a skilled trade through a combination of on-the-job training and classroom education. As such, an apprentice is a full time employee who operates under the close supervision of a skilled electrician and takes classroom instructions at night or on weekends. In other states, inmates have earned electrical apprenticeship cards by working on off-site construction projects.3 Attica does not have work release programs.4.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He is ineligible for release until 2042, at which point he’ll be 73 years old.\nMr. Vanalphen said he was transferred from Auburn to Attica about three months ago, keeps to himself and hopes to go home next year. He said he has been on medical keeplock for 30 days, until he can see a doctor for a back injury suffered that resulted in a crushed disc, pinched nerves and arthritis. He claimed that the physical therapy Attica provided was ineffective so he discontinued using it. He complained that in general the facility’s delivery of medical care was far too slow.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2978	Michael	Horton	02A3751	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Michael Horton, a 39-year-old black male, has served 12 years of a 32-year sentence. He is ineligible for parole release until 2028.\nMr. Horton said he has been a porter on A Block for three years. He said his main concerns with confinement at Attica are the serious health risks of the soy-based diet the facility switched to and started forced feeding inmates in 2009. According to Mr. Horton, all meat dishes served at Attica are made of soybean substitutes. He said the state prison facilities that house women are exempt because the diet interferes with their reproductive systems.\nInmates in some places have sued states claiming the large amounts of soy in their diets causes serious health ailments.5 The struggle for more and better prison food is a constant prison refrain, with some states feeding inmates on 56 cents per meal. According to a recent report, meals for all New York State prisons and county jails are prepared and packaged in heat-and-serve bags at an industrial scale facility at Mohawk prison for a daily cost of $2.84 per inmate.6 One study found that the diet in a Georgia\n3 See, https://www.ecmweb.com/content/inmates-turned-electricians#close-olyticsmodal\n4 See prison contributed to the risk for several chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.7	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2979	Oscar	Ferrero	02A0103	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Oscar Ferrero, a 41-year-old Hispanic male, has served 19 years of a 20-years to life sentence. He is eligible for parole in July 2020.\nMr. Ferrero said in six months he will be making his first appearance before the parole board. Mr. Ferrero said he has been under OMH care since 2003 as a diagnosed and medicated schizophrenic. He said has taken the ART and ASAT programs but needs to repeat one.\nHe said he sees his counselor for therapy on regular basis. It’s unclear whether the goal of Mr. Ferrero’s treatment was to improve his ability to function so that he could return to general population or whether he was getting the opportunity for exercise and at least four hours of structured out-of-cell therapeutic programming and/or mental health treatment on a daily basis. He said his vocational program was as a yard porter from 2004 to 2006, where he worked cleaning the yard and bathrooms. He now appears to be mostly idled.\nHe complained about personal property he lost when being transferred from Green Haven and the denial of a subsequent grievance claim about the loss. Mr. Ferrero, who is from Honduras, wishes to go home when released and has signed a deportation order to that effect.\nMr. Ferrero had visible signs of burned tobacco stains on the thumbs and forefinger of both hands, and studies have suggested that tobacco-stained fingers may hint at smoking-related diseases.8 He also complained of throat soreness, which he attributed to an old injury he said he had sustained doing back flips. I suggested he discuss the sore throat with the prison’s doctor to rule out the possibility a smoking-related ailment of the vocal cords, larynx or other areas of the throat.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2980	Dario	Ormejuste	12A3641	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Dario Ormejuste, a 34-year-old black male, has served seven years of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. He is ineligible for release. He said he’s been at Attica for six years and is working on an appeal of his sentence, which he described as 25-years to life.\nMr. Ormejuste described “everything” as “helpful and nice”. He said he sees an individual counselor for scheduled therapy sessions once a month but can request counseling at any time. He said the OMH counseling staff makes daily morning rounds on the ICP block about 20 to 30 minutes before programs begin. He said he goes to the mental health department for group counseling sessions weekdays, Monday thru Friday, from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and gets his medications administered cell-side twice daily, in the mornings and afternoons.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2987	Delvern	Duran	19B1288	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Delvern Duran, a 40-year-old black make, has served five months of an 18-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in January 2034, at age 55.\nMr. Duran said he transferred from Elmira on June 28 but did not receive his personal property when he arrived at Attica. He said he was supposed to receive personal effects within five days of being transferred but was quarantined for five days.\nMr. Duran claimed correction officers conspired to retaliate against him for beating a discilinary infraction by subsequently manufacturing a false claims against him. At a hearing, Attica’s recorded video feed substantiated Mr. Duran’s version of events and he won. Two days later, a different guard ticketed him for disobeying an order (to retract a mirror he was using to see down the opposite end of\nthe block). Mr. Duran said was keep-locked, and has been since September 16, with additional time being added for refusing a TB shot.\nHe also said he is not supposed to be assigned to housing on an upper tier because he has previously suffered seizures, for which he is currently being medicated.\n10 See	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2981	Eyal	Amrani	07A4222	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Eyal Amrani, a 57-year-old white male, who said he has served 20 ½ years of a 22-years to life sentence. He is eligible for release on parole in March 2021, with is first parole hearing scheduled for November 2020.\nMr. Amrani complained that things prohibited at Attic but available at other prison facilities makes the living conditions at Attica more oppressive by comparison. He complained about limits on the amount and variety of food served--basic stables like bread, corn flakes and single servings of jelly preserves. For example, the large-size containers of jelly sold in the commissary are impractical for inmates without access to refrigeration. (The only refrigerators I observed were on the earned housing block.)\nMr. Amrani complained that Attica inmates are not allowed to own a watch or hair trimmer for self-care. Moreover, he noted, unlike at other facilities hot pots sold at Attica’s commissary will not boil water for preparing coffee or tea. Attica’s winters are notoriously cold and individual cells lack running hot water and heaters.\nMr. Amrani also complained about inmates’ stagnant pay wages in the face of relentlessly rising commissary prices. He said, for example, cigarette prices have increased from $2.00 to $10.00 per pack. Mr. Amrani said he cannot work because of a visual disability but gets paid for attending group theraphy. He claimed the medical care at Attica is “bad” and that he has lost lots of teeth in prison.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2982	Sean	Morris	16A4905	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Sean Morris, a 31-year-old male of unknown ethnicity, has served three years of a 4- to 5-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in January 2020.\nMr. Morris complained about the laundry list of ways in which Attica correction officers routinely shortchanged inmates, which results in a deprivation of inmates’ basic needs. By regulation, inmates are entitled to “a commissary buy” every two weeks, bur Mr. Morris claims that inmate access to Attica’s commissary has been reduced to once a month and the visits are short because inmates are often forced to arrive late.9 He claimed nothing at Attica happens on time; that access to the JPay kiosk is limited to once monthly, and the kiosk on his block doesn’t work. He said he can never use the phone because his company is allowed to use the phones on alternating days based on even-odd numbering system and that their access to the yard is often as little as 30 minutes.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2983	Scott	Robinson	12B0901	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Scott Robinson, a 58-year-old Native American male, has served seven years of a 16-years to life sentence. He is eligible for parole release in September 2026, at which point he’ll be 65 years old.\nMr. Robinson complained about the adequacy of the medical care that he’s received at Attica.\nAccording to Mr. Robinson, he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a group of lung diseases, including emphysema and bronchitis, that block airflow and make it difficult to breathe. Lung damage from COPD is irreversible, but rescue inhalers can help control symptoms and minimize further damage. Mr. Robinson claims he has been trying to get his inhaler refilled, which he said is supposed to be refilled monthly, for the past five months. (The life cycle of a COPD prescription inhaler depends on dosage. An inhaler with 120 actuations, or puffs of medicine, will last 30 days if the recommended dosage is two puffs, twice a day.) Mr. Robinson said he has written countless requests for a refill, including to the superintendent. All to no avail. He even filed a grievance, but his appeal to CORC was denied because, he claims, CORC said the superintendent had not answered the request.\nOn one occasion, Mr. Robinson claims, when he suffering from pneumonia, the medical staff gave him aspirin and returned him to his cell.\nMr. Robinson also said he has been diagnosed with skin cancer. He said in 2004, the prison’s dermatologist froze six skin tumors but the tumors regrew. Mr. Robinson was apparently referring to a process often used to destroy precancerous skin lesions by freezing them with liquid nitrogen, called cryosurgery. Cryosurgery is rarely used alone to treat skin cancer. Mr. Robinson, who has been seeing the same dermatologist since 2004 despite the adverse outcome, won a grievance allowing him to see a different dermatologist. But, according to Mr. Robinson, it turned out that the state’s other prisons used the same dermatologist. It complained that it took years to get a biopsy.\nMr. Robinson said he is also diabetic and suffers from diabetic neuropathy in his feet, for which he is not being treated. He complained that he was taken off of his pain medications and has not has a finger- stick to test his capillary blood glucose levels in five months. Mr. Robinson said when treated by outside hospitals he’s been put on insulin and when returned to Attica the doctors take it away.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He is eligible for parole release in April 2020.\nMr. Krysick complained bitterly about the correction officers’ negative attitude toward inmates, which he characterized as being “completely disrespectful.” He claimed correction officers have substituted physical violence with physiological torture.\nAs it happens, Mr. Krysick’s seven-year old daughter was recently diagnosed with having leukemia and was scheduled to undergo her first treatment today. In anticipation of the impending ordeal, Mr. Krysick wrote a letter to a correction officer on his block seeking permission to telephone his daughter this morning, before the treatment begun, to offer whatever fatherly encouragement and comfort that\ncould be mustered in his absence during an stressful event in a young child’s life. He said the officer didn’t deign to even acknowledge his letter, let alone respond to or accommodate the request as an act of basic human decency.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2985	Adam	Palacios	14A5236	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Adam Palacios, a 29-year-old Hispanic male, has served five years a 6- to 7-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in October 2020.\nBefore being transferred to Attica, Mr. Palacios served time at Green Haven where he was sent to the box after, he claimed, being jumped by correction officers. Mr. Palacios claims he spends all but two hours per day in his cell. At Attica, he complained that inmates are only allowed two showers per week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, plus two additional showers outside in the yard with 400 other inmates. He said he stays in his cell until chow at 4:30 PM and returns to his cell until the evening’s recreation period, 6:00 to 7:45 PM or 8:00 to 8:45 PM.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2986	Rondell	Flowers	11B0691	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Rondell Flowers, a 50-year-old black male, has served eight years of a 20-year sentence. He is ineligible for release until 2027.\nMr. Flowers said he has been incarcerated at Attica for two years and previously served time at Elmira. He called Attica “crazy.” He characterized himself as a double-amputee, after the surgical removal of the big toe on both of his feet on September 22. He is diabetic and suffers from diabetic neuropathy in both legs. After years of taking opioids for pain management, Mr. Flowers said he was abruptly taken off of them. As a result of his unmanaged pain, his toes curled severely, eventually developing the ulcers that led to the amputations.\nMr. Flowers is also a recovering substance abuser, and since surgery feels increasingly vulnerable to relapse. To avoid that fate, Mr. Flowers has been trying for weeks to get the attention of Attica’s mental health staff so that he can get into the alcohol and substance abuse program. Mr. Flowers, who said he has been “unassigned” for two months, said he has found it virtually impossible to get the attention of the program committee, which, he said, has not responded to his written requests for a program assignment.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2988	Christopher	Faeth	00B0725	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Christopher Faeth, a 51-year-old white male, has served 19 years of a 42-years to life sentence. He is ineligible for parole release until October 2041, at which point he will be 73 years old.\nMr. Faeth said he suffers from Graves’ disease, or hyperthyroidism, which is an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones. It accelerates metabolism and can cause anxiety, hand tremors, heat sensitivity, weight loss, puffy eyes and enlarged thyroids. Mr. Faeth has been incarcerated at Attica for 16 years and suffers from those symptoms. In 2018, he had his thyroid surgically removed and suspects water contamination as the cause. He said there is a high rate of hyperthyroidism in Western New York State, and studies do show elevated cancer rates in some parts of Western New York State. Research suggest a combination of genetic and environmental factors as likely culprits.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2989	William	Wise	06B2483	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	William J. Wise, a 58-year-old white male, has (according to DOCCs records) served 13 years of a 25-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in June 2027, at age 66. He said he has been incarcerated at Attica for 15 years, and in earned housing for the last 10 years. He said he enjoys good health and voiced no complaints about the prison’s medical and dental care or food service. He did observe, however, that in more recent years inmates had less freedom of movement within the facility.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2990	Thomas	Chancey	06A1452	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Thomas Chancey, a 59-year-old black male, has served 13 years of a 25-years to life sentence. He is eligible for parole release in August 2030, at age 70.\nMr. Chancey complained that his wages have not kept pace with steadily rising prices in the prison commissary. Mr. Chancey said he has been a painter for nine years assigned to the administrative area of the prison at a grade 5 pay rate, earning a flat rate of $2.00 per day. According to inmate payroll standards, a facility can have one grade 5 position for every 300 inmates, and appointment of inmates to a grade 5 position requires the Superintendent’s approval.10 This means for Attica’s population of 1,850 inmates, there are only six grade 5 positions available. Mr. Chancey said that about five or six months ago, he was told he had worked in the administrative area for too long, and was transferred to a position as a grade 3 or 4 with fewer hours. This reduced his pay from $20/25.00 to $14.00 bi-weekly.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2991	Michael	Buck	14B2576	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Michael R. Buck, a 40-year-old white male, has served five years of a 20-year sentence. He is ineligible for parole release until November 2030. Mr. Buck, who has been incarcerated at Attica since 2014, said he works as a porter in the transitional services area. He said he was formerly a commissary worker for three years but prefers the porter job assignment because the pay is higher. He complained that the JPay tablets are not Wi-Fi accessible, but work only in conjunction with the kiosks installed in the common area of his block.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2992	Richard	Shinebarger	11B2268	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Richard E. Shinebarger, 44-year-old white male, has served eight years of a 25-year sentence. He is ineligible for parole release until July 2031.\nMr. Shinebarger complained about inefficiencies in the commissary and inmate accounting. JPay claims to be a convenient way to transfer funds to and from inmates’ trust accounts. In the notice to families announcing its contract with JPay, DOCCs said the “system will reduce the duration of time from between the deposit of funds and the availability for use by the inmate, and provide family and friends a greater variety of options to easily deposit money.” 11 Mr. Shinebarger, however, said it takes two weeks for funds to be transferred between JPay and his Attica trust account.\nAlthough an avid video gamer, Mr. Shinebarger lamented the constraints limiting access on the JPay tablets to video games and music videos. Because of the difficulty of getting access to and limits imposed on the amount of time inmates can use in the law library, Mr. Shinebarger purchased his own typewriter through a catalog from a DOCCs-approved vendor. He wishes, however, that he could use the JPay tablet to do legal research in his cell.\nMr. Shinebarger said he does not use the commissary because it is inefficient and slow. He works in the mess hall and has “problems” with the food but wasn’t willing to discuss them with me.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2993	Willie	Mckoy	18B2279	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Willie D. Mckoy, a 32-year-old black male, has served one year of a 43-years to life sentence. He is ineligible for parole release until October 2061, at which point he will be 74 years old. Mr. McKoy complained about inmates’ limited access to showers and phones on D Block. Showers are permitted twice weekly, during the evenings on Monday and Friday, despite the directive requiring three showers weekly. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings the showers and phones sit idle.Mr. McKoy had just begun the floor covering vocational program. He said the program is limited to two groups of eight inmates for a total of 16 participants. Each eight-inmate group attends classes twice-a-week for one week and then three-times-a-week the following week in alternating cycles with the other group. Others members of our monitoring team were told that the maximum participation level is 32, not 16.\nDuring the visit, we did not observe inmates actively engaged in floor covering practice or instruction. But there were numerous artistic placards on display, mostly prepared during the prior instructors’ tenure. We were, however, shown new flooring that the current instructor had installed in the barbering classroom, which, by all appearance, was the product of professional workmanship that appeals to modern sensibilities. My best guess is that this translates into the potential for inmates to acquire commercially marketable floor covering skills.\nIn the vocational area, we also visited the closed print shop and interrupted a remedial reading class and a classroom being converted from a room for teaching small engine repair to a painting and decorating class. In the classroom undergoing renovations, the welding instructor was working with three students making and installing a steel cage to secure the room’s equipment, tools and supplies. Again, if the instructor’s observable work product is a useful proxy, then it’s fair to conclude the potential exist for inmates to acquire commercially marketable welding skills. We did not see the welding shop, so cannot opine on the capacity limits for participants.\nThe print shop, where inmates print administrative forms used internally at Attica and other area prisons, was closed, apparently because the instructor quit or retired. It would be difficult to assess the marketability of skills an inmate learns in Attica’s printing course. The commercial printing industry has become such a small part of the U.S. economy that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics no longer tracks its monthly jobs report.12 Obviously, Attica’s printing equipment, offset press, is outdated. But offset printing is still commonly and widely used in the commercial printing process.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2999	Darren	Bridges	16B3112	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Darren Bridges, a 24-year-old white male, has served three years of a 6-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in October 2020.\nMr. Bridges, who said he been incarcerated since age 19, has been at Attica since December 7, 2018. He was ticketed for fighting in the yard and ordered keep-locked for 60 days. He said he has completed the ASAT program and five weeks of ART but will lose ART credit and have to restart that program. Mr. Bridges said he is also fighting a different ticket that cost him seven months of good time credit. As a Category I offender, Mr. Bridges said when he is released on parole he will be required to wear an ankle monitoring bracelet for five years.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

2994	Hector	Rodriguez	16A3121	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Hector Rodriguez, a 29-year-old Hispanic male, has served three years of a 15-years to life sentence. He is ineligible for parole release until March 2030.\nMr. Rodriguez has been assigned to the barbering program since June 2019. He said at a meeting in May with the program committee, he was shown a list of available vocational programs. He selected general business and was assigned there until the instructor retired. He was then assigned to the print shop, which prints the administrative forms used at Attica, Wyoming and other area prisons (presumably those in the Western Region or the Wende Hub). But the print shop lost its instructor and also temporarily closed. Mr. Rodriguez was then assigned to barbering, which accommodates only 15 students, nine attending classes on even days and six attending classes on odd days.\nFor a facility of its size with a population of 1,850 inmates (and maximum capacity of 2,143 inmates), Attica’s vocational training and program capacity is severely constrained. The superintendent gave us a tour of the site where the state plans to break ground in April 2020 to construct a new “state of the art” program building, which will include an academic building and a new mess hall, library and law library.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2995	Marcus	Scott	00B2819	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Marcus Scott is a 38-year-old black male who has been imprisoned since age 19. He has served 19 years of a 25-years to life sentence, and is eligible for parole release in March 2025.\nMr. Scott is an Inmate Program Associate (“IPA”) in transitional services. He teaches Phase I and Phase III classes. Phase I is a three week indoctrination program that assist incoming inmates in transitioning to prison. All inmates are required to take Phase I, which consists of courses on subjects like maintaining relationships and community ties, work ethic, decision making, goal setting, time management and socialization skills. Phase II, an eight-week cognitive behavioral program, is also in transitional services but taught by staff, not IPAs. The Phase III classes, which IPAs teach, are designed to help inmates with planning for reentry and consist of preparing a portfolio of vital documents and certificates and cover subjects like mock job interviews, job search plans and family reintegration.\nDuring the monitoring visit, there was one participant in Mr. Scott’s Phase I class. After introducing myself and questioning Mr. Scott about transitional services, he was sufficiently comfortable on his own initiative to ask if I wanted to meet transitional services’ head staffer, walked me down the hall without a security escort, and then interrupted a staff member who was leading a group of approximately 20 participants completing IPA training. The IPA training is a 45-hour program training inmates to become assistants to Attica’s administrative staff in the transitional services, education and vocational programs	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2996	Jemar	Kelley	05B1637	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Jemar Kelley, a 43-year-old black male, has served 14 years of a 43-years to life sentence. He is eligible for parole release in March 2050, at age 74.\nJemar Kelley is a member of the TEDx working group that recently hosted a TEDx program at Attica. Mr. Kelley made a presentation on his involvement in Attica’s Youth Assistance Program in which inmates mentor at-risk youth by offering guidance on the risks and consequences of antisocial activity, drug and alcohol abuse, peer influence, family dysfunction and the like. Mr. Kelley said he has two daughters in college with whom he is very close and who are proud of his participation in the TEDx talk.\nThe TEDx working group, which appeared to consist of several staffers and half-a-dozen or so inmates, were assembled in a classroom. Mr. Kelley, who was working alone at conference room-type table, was busily assembling various iterations of the draft scripts that each participant had prepared and used during filming. Other inmates were seated but appeared to be casually engaged in some form of related activity. In contrast to the high level of security and tension palpable in other areas of Attica (in particular, the main entrance screening area, the tunnels and housing block areas, and Times Square), the classroom seemed to be free of stress and the inmates and staff freely mingled among and chatted with us.\nIt’s difficult to say whether the scene was staged for our benefit. But overall, the presence of security in the transitional services, education and vocational programs was noticeably absent and the inmates’ brighter disposition and rosier attitudes seem to reflect that fact.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2997	Niguel	Molinar	16A4773	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Niguel Molinar, a 29-year-old black male, has served three years of a 5-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in April 2020.\nAccording to Mr. Molinar, when he arrived at Attica on August 6 he was quarantined for 10 days without personal property or basic necessities like soap and toilet paper. He claims a DOCCs directive limits the quarantine for a sergeant to review incoming inmates to 72 hours. He completed orientation and was assigned to floor covering because ASAT was unavailable. On September 6, Mr. Molinar was ticketed for having contraband (he says, an empty container of sorts), ordered keep-locked for 60 days and lost access to his television and hot pot. Also, while keep-locked, Mr. Molinar claims he has lost access to the law library.\nHe complained that the food is “horrible” and served in unsanitary conditions, sometimes with trays caked with food from prior meals or cold because guards are slow to distribute them after they’ve arrived from the mess hall. He also denounced the interminable package delays inmates are forced to endure.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
2998	Daniel	Meyers	16A2488	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Daniel Meyers, a 35-year-old black male, has served three years of a 7 1/2-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in January 2022.\nMr. Meyers complained that JPay tablets have become another quiver in guards’ punishment arsenal, He claimed Attica is the only facility that strips inmates on keep-lock of their hot pots, televisions and tablets. He also said the correction officers have effectively reduced recreation time to 30:00-45:00 minutes, and that some guards have tried to bargain inmates into forgoing recreation time on weekends (presumably so the officers can stay inside to watch football games) in exchange for longer stints on weekdays.\nMr. Meyers, who was ordered keep-locked for 60 days, said he also lost transfer rights. At a subsequent hearing, he complained that correction officers did not inform him that his mother had died while he was on keep-lock. Mr. Meyers didn’t challenge the ticket and was found guilty but the hearing officer gave him telephone rights, he believes, to atone for guards having withheld the information about the death of his mother.\nMr. Meyers also complained about being allowed only two eight-minute showers per week and given only six seconds of hot water twice a day.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

3000	Richard	Moore	07B3844	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Richard Moore, a 36-year-old black male, has served 12 years of a 20-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in March 2024.\nMr. Moore, who is a lobby porter, said he has six children, the youngest a two-years-old. His family visits from Buffalo frequently. He complained about the lack of accommodations for young children in the prison’s visiting room—the concrete floors are uncarpeted and there are no games or toys to occupy children’s time and attention. He said he does have access to telephones on weekends, and sometimes when porters are out of their cells guards let them use the telephone.\nMr. Moore has been incarcerated at Attica for 11 years, and noted that the installation of cameras has significantly reduced the level of violence by guards. He characterized the facility’s medical care as “shaky.” He said “they give aspirins for everything”; if you get sick, “you will die here.” By contrast, Mr. Moore said the dental care is “real good” and that every year he gets his teeth cleaned. He said there is too much soy is the food, claiming that Governor Cuomo has vowed to take soy out of prisons and jails.\nI noticed that Mr. Moore had several cases of bottled water in his cell. He claimed that Attica’s water had sickened inmates and that he wife, who wants him to return home healthy, helps pay for his ample supply of bottled water.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He said his family arrived for a visit at 9:00 AM and were kept waiting until 2:00 PM before Mr. Witherow could reach them in the visitation area. Since then, Mr. Witherow said, after being force to wait five hours for the visit to begin, his son-in-law has not returned to visit him once.\nMr. Withrow also said that access to the law library was too limited and that excessive constraints on inmate movement is a common denominator in many of the problems inmates encounter at Attica.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3002	Khalil	Dunaway	16B2869	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Khalil Dunaway, a 31-year-old black male, has served three years of a 14-year sentence. He is eligible for parole release in November 2027, at age 39.\nMr. Dunaway rattled off many of the complaints voiced by other inmates: poor water quality; long delays in visitation; exorbitant commissary prices; abbreviated recreation time; and needlessly artificial limits on access to things like JPay kiosks.\nAccording to Mr. Dunaway, unlike at other facilities, the hot pots sold in the commissary at Attica are pre-set at a temperature that will not bring water to boil. If altered to boil water, guards will confiscate them. Similarly, although the model of televisions sold in the commissary comes equipped with speakers, guards remove the speakers. If inmates add their own speakers, guards take the televisions. Inmates are given access to JPay kiosks only once a week, and they are blocked from using its secure email function. Also, visitors arriving at 9:00 AM are forced to wait endlessly, often to 12:00 or 1:30 PM before inmates arrive, and visitation ends at 3:15 PM. Finally, Mr. Dunaway said he gets about 25 minutes of recreation time. He said guards spend	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He is eligible for parole release in July 2028, days before this 74th birthday.\nMr. Blake, who was transferred to Attica from Green Haven, is one of the rare inmates claiming to like Attica and to prefer it over other facilities. He said he prefers Attica because its correction officers treat him better and the place is run better than other prisons. Mr. Blake said he’s an avid reader of thrillers and car magazines but does not use the prison’s library. He described the prison’s delivery of medical and dental care services as “fine”, nothing that dental is currently in the process of making a set of dentures for him (he appeared to be toothless, or nearly so). Mr. Blake called the food quality “terrible.” He said he only eats breakfast in the mess hall a few days a week and buys all other meals in the commissary.\nMr. Blake said he has purchased games on the JPay tablet. He said he has lost contact with his son five years ago and does not get visitors. He said he still writes his son and sends him money on Christmas and for his birthdays but that his letters go unanswered.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He is eligible for parole release in June 2026.\nMr. Davis said he has been at Attica for one and one-half years, and his biggest frustration is the difficulty of communicating with and keeping connected to his family in Syracuse. He claimed he’s\nallowed only one 10-minute telephone call each week. He also said he’s allowed only two showers each week, and must attend to personal hygiene using a bucket and cold water during the rest of the week.\nMr. Davis said he has no known health issues. He also complained, however, that he doesn’t “do anything” all day. He said he’s in the porter program, but is not given work because the guards only “deal with people they can control.” Although he has years left on his sentence, he asked for information about reentry. He took CANY’s mailing address and may follow up on that inquiry.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

That other person was on one to one suicide watch in the cell next to Mr. Karris’s. The one to one suicide watch involved an officer outside the cell and a camera.\nb. Mr. Karris made a up a few different names (Wishbone) for himself and that he gave to me but at the end of the conversation gave me his real name. It was difficult for me to follow his comments and to hear him. Mr. Karris seemed to be in very poor mental health and hygiene condition. Mr. Karris was accused (and maybe convicted?) of beating his cell mate to death at Five Points in 2014.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He said getting to visits is a problem with waits between 45 – 60 minutes and visits starting late. He said it takes longer because they are running yard at the same time as visits.

He said commissary is late and staff keep taking away phone access. He said they also do not get enough showers in general population, only two per week. He said this is not right because even in keeplock you are supposed to get 3 showers per week.   \nb. He said the soy food is disgusting and violence has stopped because of cameras.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

3048	Brandon	Latson	04R3286	Attica	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	a. He has been housed in every max security prison. He said there are a number of problems at Attica. Visiting is suffering because people are waiting for hours; there are moldy showers in C Block and the outside showers are even worse; the selection process for getting to the law library is not fair and biased. He said B Block signed and submitted petitions in August and September 2019 regarding these issues.	\N	2019-10-23	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

3054	William	Henderson	06A2008	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Reported that security will mess with programs--not let you go, not let you into a new program, if they don't like you. Huge abuses of power and authority. Security staff will keep your ID and program card if there's an incident--blocking from going out of cell, using phone, getting commissary. The Dep of Programs has a "nasty attitude" and doesn't let people get the programs they want and need. Mail is consistently late, and food rots in packages. Green Haven CF is the worst facility he has been to (out of many). There has been a big positive change since the body cams came in. Lots of racism, COs don't let Black guys in the gym or hold certain positions in the facility. "It's like I'm getting sentenced again every day in here"	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3055	Ernesto	Lopez	04A1978	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Violence has gone down because of body cams. Medical is severely lacking, they diagnose and dismiss when they don't know what's happening. Not enough kiosk time and very disorganized.	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3056	Charles	Wright	16A0742	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	The package room denies things that are permitted in other facilities or that have been received before at GHCF. Rules change week by week and different officers always give different responses. Letters go missing all the time--admin excuse for this is that they are understaffed. The environement is hostile--no matter what it is always their word against ours and we are not believed. In medical, they only ever give ibuprofen. One doctor in particular is very dismissive. This person was moved to f block a month ago and has not been given a new program card so has been locked in with no programs or idle pay. Admin says they "can't find his program card". Multiple grievances written with no response.	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3057	Anthony	Corey	01A1718	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Severe stomach pain/constipation and anxiety. Being given lactulose for constipation and milk of magnesia for the pain. After talking for a few minutes, he disclosed that his friend had stomach pain that was dismissed for months and then was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer and died weeks later. No one on medical has asked about this or addressed his anxiety about misdiagnosis. Also has open facial sores that he believes are connected to the lactulose. Says "If you're not bleeding or dying, medical doesn't care and won't treat you". He feels very hopeless, we discussed changes on the outside and I urged him to keep his chin up and continue staying close with his family who is supportive. He started crying and said "this is the first time someone has been kind to me in here"	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3058	Juan	Castro	97A5407	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Visible eye injury--was in a fight in the mess hall and officers "jammed pepper spray into my eye". Injury is localized to his left eye only--indicating close range spray directly into that eye. After being sprayed, he was put into a body hold and pinned on the ground with hands behind his back. Misbehavior report stated "OC was ineffective against inmate, so CO put him in a body hold". Mr. Castro says he "went down right away". He was not taken to eye wash, and instead was made to use dial soap while COs splashed his face with water, which further irritated it. He had OC spray all over his clothes and face/body, but was not allowed to shower for over 24 hours, causing pain. His eye still hurts but he went to sick call and the eye injury was treated by medical--eye specialist called in and gave drops. Currently on KL indefinitely awaiting hearing date. Officers are way too loose with the pepper spray and still carry sticks against directive 4093. They can't access body cam footage for any issue they have, always told it wasn't on or footage is unavailable (footage is always available to defend officers).

3059	Jorge	Rodriguez	06A4010	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mr. Rodriguez has been with no program or idle pay for 2 months. For two days his cell door wouldn't open so he was unable to attend program, then was suspended for missing program. He was told that he must see the program committee to get a new program, but has not had a call-out for 2 months. The CO who tried to open his door told him to write to the superintendent, which he did. Received a response that he is still suspended because there was "no evidence the door was broken". Mr. Rodriguez hasn't seen the attending CO since this happened and does not know his name, so is unable to confirm. Many grievances written with no response	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3060	Justice	Jones	16A3802	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Dental issue--been asking for dental for over a year with no callout or response. Notarization is also an issue--had a callout to the law library to see a notary this morning at 10am but was not notified by a CO until 1pm so unable to go--now missed a deadline for litigation paperwork.	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3061	Louis	Geroyianis	10B3123	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Recently got out of a wheelchair and has serious medical problems. Medical is dismissive and rude, it takes 6 months to see a doctor and everyone gets ibuprofen. He has been at GHCF for one year and has had 3 different PCPs assigned to him. It takes forever to see a specialist but the DOCCS docs don't follow the specialist's orders. Mr. Geroyianis was granted a deathbed visit for his brother who passed away a month ago. He, his attending CO, and his PCP all put in a mental health referral for him to help manage the grief but he got no response at all from OMH. When asked if he wanted us to bring it up to them to try to get him an appointment, he refused because "I know they don't care, so why should I meet with them now?" Serving 22-life for burglary and very hopeless that anything can change	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

3063	David	Reese	15A3528	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mail is very slow. Green Haven is very disorganized and has less freedom of movement than other facilities. No music or tvs in this facility which makes it difficult to pass time. Very reluctant to give his name because of fears of retaliation. Only provided name and DIN after I assured him it would not be given to DOCCS or anyone else.	Emily Appel	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

3064	Spencer	Jackson	15A3058	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Hopefully being released in March, has not received any discharge planning yet. Wants to be paroled out of state but his ORC told him he wouldn't be allowed to (CANY Staff confirmed this is not true). Not enough programs for people to better themselves (mental health, education, family participation, etc). Medical is terrible--if it isn't life threatening they don't care at all.

3116	Luis	Ramos	09A2415	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mr. Ramos, in F-block, spoke about retaliation from staff and the general mistreatment incarcerated people like himself face from them, no matter how respectful you might be. He said that the COs treat them like they're not human. He also made note of the fact that the kiosks, where they can buy and download items for their tablets, are only accessible once a week, and only if the COs are on top of it, or if it's even working. The kiosks are located on every block, on every company. They could simply stroll up to them in their free time  and give the prison money. Mr. Ramos questioned why they even gave them the ability if they were just going to make it incredibly difficult to use.	Nora Demere	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3117	Orlando	Ramos	16A2170	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mr. Ramos made note of a handful of issues at GH.

3119	Marc	Douglas	07A2081	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mr. Douglas said that the law library is accessible depending on who you know, and how much money you can spend. He also made note of how the tablets seem to be the prisons' way of placating the masses; he however pointed out all the educational tools available on it, if you know what to look for. He further articulated how more often than not, they are brought to rec late, so it ends up being significantly shorter than scheduled. All the TVs are broken as well.

3120	Gregory	Washington	98A4501	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mr. Washington spoke passionately about the root of prison: money and control. Further, he describes the aforementioned kiosks and the cruel treatment those incarcerated at GH are experiencing. He mentioned how some of the heating pipes don't work, causing it to be extremely cold in some areas. He also was asking about the law that would raise the wages to $3/hour for some jobs, and how dispicable it is that they are compensated in such a way, while the prison gets all the wealth from their labor. He is 65 years old with a 75 to life sentence. RAPP.	Nora Demere	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

3122	Jamal	Wilson	07A7175	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mr. Wilson gave insight into many aspects of life at GH. He explained the run around many experience with respect to medical; as an example, he himself was told that they would schedule an outside appointment for him, but that was months ago. He did state that they have a dentist, and a lot of programs, but that was the extent ofhis compliment. He explained the ridiculously high prices in commissary (compared to their wages), and that the law library is too small for the prison population. He also mentioned that soy is in everything they eat.	Nora Demere	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He is trying to gain clemency. He has a 50 to life sentence. He also made note of the short rec time (because of COs being slow/late to bring them to rec), and the complete lack of nutrition in the food they are given.	Nora Demere	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N
3125	Eric	Witherspoon	10A1948	Green Haven	Incarcerated Person	Prison visit	Mr. Witherspoon made note of the rodents and roaches in the mess hall, how they cover the room in the morning. He also pointed out how the DOCCS manual states that they should be given access to the kiosk every day, unless a facility decides otherwise. You can see the kiosk from his cell. But he can only use it once a week. He is 50 years old and has a 20 to life sentence for burglary. RAPP	Nora Demere	2019-12-12	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	\N

He keeps getting set up and then put in solitary by COs. He's been punished repeatedly for refusing a bunkmate. When he finally accepted a bunkmate to avoid punishment (despite the fact that he has a court order in his security folder and an order from DOCCS commissioner), he was assaulted by his bunkmate, who cut him with a razor. Mr Young was put in SHU and his bunkmate received no punishment and was transferred. The same thing happened again after he got out of SHU. He also maintains that he was wrongfully convicted. He also describes a staff assault in 2014 that was covered up by the administration. He describes rampant staff racism and a culture of abuse, assaults, corruption, and retaliation by staff. Things have gotten worse with COVID and staff do not wear masks. He wants to be transferred out, ideally back to Shawangunk.

3874	Eric	Hanushek	18G0182	Albion	Friend	Email	Mr Hanushek contacted us about his friend, Suzanne Dizak. She became ill while at Bedford Hills in 2018 with a MRSA infection. The infection was never properly treated even though she filed many medical slips. Medical records have been incomplete, incorrect and falsified. Her condition has continued to worsen through medical negligence. Despite showing visible signs of illness, she was transferred to Albion. At this point, she is in constant pain, has severe neurological problems, cannot eat without nausea and diarrhea, as well as many other issues. The staff (medical and corrections) threatens her with punishment when she is limited by her illness. He has contacted the facility, Albany and lawyers, without success.

Mr. Billotti said he has been housed in T-ICP on and off since 2015 at Clinton, Sing Sing and Elmira (since March 2019).

Mr. Billotti has had a positive experience with Elmira’s medical services. He said he voluntarily turned in his razor to avoid self-harm and that the doctor, who he characterized as experienced, courteous and helpful, was “trying to level me out.” He said he can talk to the COs and they “try to help you.” He complained that the “food could be better.” In six months, according to Mr. Billotti, he will be making his third appearance before the parole board, having been previously twice denied parole.	\N	2019-08-17	\N	2020-07-24 00:00:00	{"din":["99A7055"],"name":["BILLOTTI, ROBERT JR"],"sex":["MALE"],"dob":["10/30/1972"],"ethnicity":["WHITE"],"custody_status":["IN CUSTODY"],"facility":["ELMIRA"],"date_received_orig":["12/27/1999"],"date_received_curr":["12/27/1999"],"admission_type":["NEW COMMITMENT"],"commit_county":["SUFFOLK"],"date_released_last":[""],"type_released_last":[""],"charges":[[{"crime":"MURDER 2ND","class":"A1"}]],"agg_min_sentence":["0018 Years, 00 Months, 00 Days"],"agg_max_sentence":["LIFE Years, 99 Months, 99 Days"],"date_earliest_release":["05/2021"],"type_earliest_release":["PAROLE HEARING DATE"],"date_parole_hearing":["05/2021"],"type_parole_hearing":["REAPPEARANCE"],"date_parole_eligibility":["10/05/2016"],"date_conditional_release":["NONE"],"date_max_expiration":["LIFE"],"date_max_expiration_parole_supervision":[""],"date_max_expiration_postrelease_supervision":[""],"date_parole_board_discharge":[""]}
